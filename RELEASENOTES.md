### üîß Development Scripts & Commands
```bash
# Quick Start
./start.sh              # Start all services with health checks
./start.sh --clean      # Clean database restart

# Development
cd frontend && bun run dev    # Frontend development server
cd backend && go run main.go  # Backend development server

# Testing
./test-functionality.sh       # End-to-end integration tests
cd backend && ./test.sh       # Backend unit + integration tests
cd frontend && bun run test   # Frontend component tests

# Build & Deploy
./build-all.sh               # Production build pipeline

```

### üåê API Endpoints
All endpoints use `/api/v1` prefix:
- `GET /members` - List all team members
- `POST /members` - Create a new team member
- `GET /teams` - List all teams
- `POST /teams` - Create a new team
- `POST /assign/:teamId/:memberId` - Assign member to team
- `POST /feedback` - Submit feedback

### ü§ñ AI Development Experience
This project serves as a comprehensive proof-of-concept for Claude Code capabilities:

#### Strengths Demonstrated
- **Local Development**: Runs on local machine with full system access
- **Token Transparency**: Clear visibility into token usage and costs
- **Performance**: Fast execution compared to cloud-based alternatives
- **Code Quality**: Superior code generation compared to other AI tools
- **Testing Integration**: Automatically adds both unit and integration tests
- **Bug Detection**: Catches and fixes bugs during test execution
- **Resource Efficiency**: ~30% CPU usage, 0.6% RAM (384 MB on 64GB system)
- **Functional Delivery**: Working application even with incomplete features

#### Development Insights
- **Token Usage**: Approximately 1 hour of coding per token limit cycle
- **Task Complexity**: Successfully handled complex full-stack development
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation generation capabilities
- **Version Control**: Proper git workflow with meaningful commit messages

### üéØ Service URLs
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8080/api/v1  
- **Database**: localhost:3306 (coaching_user/coaching_password)

### üìã Getting Started
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd claude-code-poc

# Start the full stack
./start.sh

# Open your browser
open http://localhost:3000
```

### üîç Testing & Quality Assurance
